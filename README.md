# Surf's Up

Module 9



**Overview of the analysis:**

The purpose of this analysis is to gather temperature trends in Oahu of June and December. We are comparing the two months in anticipation of opening a surf shop on the island. Before opening the store data on temperature trends needs to be collected an analyzed. If the island has 'surf-able' weather during the summer and winter would mean the surf shop could be open year long. We are using June, the first month of summer, as our baseline and comparing it to December, the first month of winter. If we don't see a drastic difference in temperature between the two that would mean the shop could be open year round. 


**Results:**

* The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees, and for December it is 71.0. 

* The highest temperature in June was 85 degrees, and for December it was 83. 

* The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees, and the lowest temperature recorded in December was 56 degrees.

**Summary:**

From comparing the temperature of June and December I can conclude that there is only a slight difference in temperatures between the two months. The average temperatures for both months has only a 4 degree difference. Even though it is winter, the highest temperature recorded in December was 83 degrees, comparing that to June's high of 85 that isn't much of a difference. However, one thing to mention in December the recorded low was 56 degrees. We can do further analysis to figure out at what time that was recorded. Winter nights usually get cold. One suggestion would be to close shop earlier in the winter.
